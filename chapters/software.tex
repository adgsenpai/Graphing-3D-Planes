\subsection{Graphing with the Python (Matplotlib library)}

Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected.
We will use the python language with the language a package called matplotlib. This package is a collection of several plotting libraries. It is endorsed by Matlab but Matlab is paid the stuff i am showing your is free.

\subsubsection{Setting up environment}

First you need to install Python. This is done by opening a terminal and typing the following:
Note this is for linux users.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
sudo apt-get install python3    
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
\end{lstlisting}

For windows users, you can download the python installer from here: https://www.python.org/downloads/ or install it using the windows store.

Then you need to install the matplotlib package. This is done by typing the following:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
pip install matplotlib
\end{lstlisting}

pip or pip3 depending on the pip you got ...

If you are struggling check out some tutorials on YouTube on Python or do a course on it.

\subsection{Graphing with Geogebra (Online Web Platform)}
For the purposes of this paper, we will use the Geogebra Web Platform. This is a free online platform that allows you to graph 3D graphs and equations. You dont need to be logged in to use this platform or install anything on your computer. This is a website/cloud platform.
GeoGebra is an interactive geometry, algebra, statistics and calculus application, intended for learning and teaching mathematics and science from primary school to university level. GeoGebra is available on multiple platforms, with apps for desktops, tablets and web.

\subsubsection{Our first Geogebra session}

To get started with Geogebra, we will first create a new Geogebra workspace. This is done by opening a new Geogebra window which is followed by going to this link:
https://www.geogebra.org/3d?lang=en

it would look like this below:
\begin{figure}[htb]

\end{figure}

You can now get started with graphing.

For additional things to do check out the tools in the tools tab. It looks like something like this.

\end{figure}

The way you learn is by experimenting have fun!

\subsubsection{Plotting equations and vectors}
To plot any equation just type it in the Geogebra workspace. And for plotting a point in the 3D space. Just express your vector as a tuple of coordinates.

In this diagram i have plotted some 3D equations and vectors.
